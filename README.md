# Spot Nuclei. Speed Cures.

## Overview
The 2018 Data Science Bowl challenges participants to develop an algorithm to automate nucleus detection, which can accelerate research for various diseases such as cancer, heart disease, Alzheimerâ€™s, and diabetes. Automating nucleus detection can lead to faster drug development and improved understanding of cellular responses to treatments.

## Why Nuclei Detection?
Identifying cell nuclei is crucial for biological research because:
- Most human cells contain a nucleus with DNA, which controls cellular function.
- Detecting nuclei helps researchers analyze cell reactions to treatments.
- Accelerating nucleus detection can reduce the time needed to bring new drugs to market.

## Dataset
- **Source:** 2018 Data Science Bowl
- **Structure:**
  - **Images:** RGB images of cells
  - **Labels:** Binary mask images representing nucleus locations
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Resize images and masks to `(128, 128)`
  - Normalize pixel values to `[0, 1]`
  - Convert mask values from `[0, 255]` to `[0, 1]`
- **Format:** Numpy arrays converted to TensorFlow tensors

## Model Architecture
The project uses a **UNet-based model** designed for image segmentation:
- **Encoder:** Contracting path with convolutional and pooling layers
- **Bottleneck:** Bridge layer with convolutional filters
- **Decoder:** Expanding path with transposed convolutions and skip connections

### Summary:
- Input size: `(128, 128, 3)`
- Output size: `(128, 128, 1)`
- Loss function: Binary cross-entropy
- Optimizer: Adam
- Metric: Accuracy
